# Welcome to the Factory
Customers are lining up around the block, because they know we sell the **best** kittens in town.
Our kittens are raised with love and care, ensuring they grow up to be healthy and happy companions.

It's up to you, dear engineer, to help us keep up with the demand and make sure every kitten finds its forever home.

## Our Software Philosophy
Don't let the name fool you, we are a software company first and foremost.
We build tools that help us manage our kitten inventory, track customer orders, and streamline our operations.

This blog covers everything from architecture to testing, and is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about software development.

## The Business
Our business rules are simple: customers can browse our selection of kittens, place orders, and schedule deliveries.
We offer a variety of customizations, genetic mutations, and accessories to make each kitten unique.
Customers are our top priority, and we strive to provide exceptional service at every opportunity: in order to do so, we must ensure we track **every single piece** of data on our customers.
After all, a well-researched customer is an easier customer to please.
